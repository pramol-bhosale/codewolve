            <h2>Let's learn more about Google Crawlers and Google Crawling</h2>
            <p>
Today
I'll dive into the

Search Console Crawl Stats

report, which

provides data on crawl

requests, average

response time, and more.

<p>
To find out how often

Google crawls your site

and what the responses were, you

should use the Search Console

Crawl Stats report,

which provides

statistics about Google's

crawling behavior.</p>
<p>
Here are some questions you can

answer with the data provided.
<ul>
    <li>
        What's your site's

        general availability?
    </li>
    <li>

        What's the average page

        response for a crawl request?
    </li>

    <li>
        How many requests

        were made by Google
        
        to your site in
        
        the last 90 days?
    </li>
</ul>


<p>

Let's dive in to learn

more about the report.

Log in to Search

Console and find

the Settings page, where you

can open the Crawl Stats report.</p>
<p>
<strong>
    Know that this report is
    
    only available for properties
    
    at the domain level.
    
   </strong>

<p>
In the summary page, you'll

find a lot of information.

The main elements are the
<ul>
    <li>
        Crawling trends chart  
    </li>
    <li>
        Host status details
    </li>
    <li>
        Crawl request breakdown
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2 id="one">1) Crawling Trend Chart in Crawl Report</h2>
<p>
    The chart shows the

    trends for three metrics.
    
    The total crawl request
    
    for URLs on your site,
    
    whether successful or not.    

Request resources hosted outside

of your site are not counted.</p><p>

So if your images are

served on another domain,

such as a content

delivery network or CDN,

they will not appear here.
</p>
<h2 id="two">What is Total download size in Crawl Report ?</h2>
   <p>
    The total download size from

    your site during crawling.
If Google casts a page resource

that is used by multiple pages,

the resource is only

requested the first time.
</p>
<h2 id="three">
    What is page

    response time in Crawl Report?
</h2>
<p>
The average page

response time for a crawl

request to retrieve

the page content.

</p><p class="praImportant">
    <samp>&#128204</samp>
This metric does not include

retrieving page resources

such as scripts,

images, and other

linked or embedded content.

</p>

<p>

    
The response time

does not account

for page rendering time.

</p>
<p>
Look for major spikes,

drops, and trends

over time in your data.</p>
<p>

For example, if you see a

significant drop in total crawl

requests, make sure no one added

a new robots.txt to your site.

Or maybe your site is

responding slowly to Googlebot.

These might be understood as a

sign your server cannot handle

all the requests.
</p>
<p>

Another example would

be a consistent increase

in average response time.

This might not affect your

crawl rate immediately,

but it's a good indicator

that your servers might not

be handling all the load.
Ultimately, this may affect

user experience, too.
</p>
<h2 id="four">What is Host status Report in Crawl Report ? </h2>
<p>


The host status is

an easy way for you

to check your site's general

availability in the last 90

days.</p><p>

If you verified your website

as a domain property,

you will see all child

hosts separately here.</p>
<p>
    
This can be very handy to

evaluate all your hosts

performance in one place.

</p>
<p>

    When you click to get

    the host status details,
    
    you'll find three categories.
    
</p>
<h2 id="five">
  What is  Error section in Crawl Report?
</h2>
<p>
    
Errors in this section mean

Google cannot crawl your site

for a technical reason.

Robots.txt fetch tells

you the failure rate

when crawling your

robots.txt file.
</p>
<p>
    
Your site is not required

to have a robots.txt file,

but it must return the

successful response 200 or 404

when asked for this file.

</p><p>
    
If Googlebot has a connection

issue, for example, a 503,

it will stop crawling your site.
</p>
<h3>XWhat is DNS Resolution in Crawl Report?</h3>
<p>
    
DNS resolution tells

you when your DNS server

didn't recognize your

host name or didn't

respond during crawling.
If you see an issue here,

check with your register

to make sure your site

is correctly set up

and that your server is properly

connected to the internet.
</p>
<h3>What is Server Connectivity in Crawl Report?</h3>
<p>
Server connectivity tells

you when your server

was unresponsive or did not

provide the full response

for your URL during a crawl.
</p>

<strong>
    If you're seeing spikes or

consistent connectivity issues

here, you might need to

talk to your provider

about increasing your capacity

or fixing availability issues.
</strong>
<p>
    
If Google found at least

one of those errors

on your site in

the last week, you

will find a warning alerting

you of problems last week.

</p>
<strong>
    Dig deeper into the

error and fix it.
</strong>
<p>

    
If Google found at least

one error on your site

in the last 90 days, but it

occurred more than a week ago,

you will see a warning that

you had problems in the past.


You should check

your server logs

or contact the

developer to review

what the problems were

and decide whether you

need to take any action.
</p>
<p>
If Google didn't find

any crawl availability

issues on your site in the

past 90 days, you're all green.

Good job.
</p>
<h2 id="six">
    Crawl Request Cards in Crawl Report
</h2>

<p>

    
The crawl request cards

show several breakdowns

to help you understand

what Google crawlers found

in your website.
</p>
<p>
    
There are four

available breakdowns.

</p>
<h3>I) 
    Crawl response
    </h3>
     <p>
        
Crawl response

shows the responses

that Google received

when crawling your site.

Common response types would be

200, 301, 404 or server errors.
    </p>
<h3>II) Crawl file type </h3>
<p>
    Crawl file type shows file

types returned by the request.

Common file types would be HTML,

image, article or JavaScript.

</p>
<h3>
    III) Crawl Purpose
</h3>
<p>
    Crawl purpose could be discovery

when a URL is new to Google,

or refresh for a

re-crawl of a known page.


</p>
<h3>IV) GoogleBot type</h3>
<p>
    Google type shows the

user agent used by Google

to make the crawl request.

For example, smartphone,

desktop, image, and others.

</p>
<p>
    Click any row to drill

down to that value

and review its strengths

and specific sample URLs.
</p>
<h2 id="seven">Summary of Crawl Report in Google search Console</h2>
<p>

    To help you understand and

    optimize Google's crawling,
    
    you should use the Search
    
    Console Crawl Stats report.
    <ul>
        <li>

            Use the summary page

            chart to analyze
            
            crawling volume and trends.
            
        </li>
        <li>

            Use the host status details

            to check your site's
            
            general availability.
        </li>
        <li>
            And use the crawl

request breakdown

to understand what

Googlebot is finding

when crawling your website.
        </li>
    </ul>
